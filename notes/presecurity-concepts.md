*Notes from the TryHackMe Presecurity course, written for quick review and better understanding of key concepts.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Offensive Security** - simulating a hacker to improve security
- **Roles**:
  - **Penetration Tester** - tests system vulnerabilities
  - **Red Teamer** - simulates a real attack
  - **Security Engineer** - builds protection and security systems
- **Defensive Security** - **Blue Teams** - know how to react to an attack
- **SOC (Security Operations Center)** - Experts who monitor the network for threats. They use SIEM systems to block the attacker’s connection.
- **Threat Analysis** - Logs and public articles give us data about hackers
  - Who is attacking? 
  - What methods are used? 
  - Why are they attacking?
- **DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)** - Investigation and response to security incidents
1. **Digital Forensics** - After an attack, specialists investigate the incident: (What happened? How did it happen? When did it happen?) They analyze hard drives, RAM, system logs, and network communication.
2. **Incident Response** - After an attack, the goal is to reduce damage, stop the threat and restore the system to its original state
3. **Malware Analysis** - studying what the malware actually does.
    - **Types of malware**:
      - **Viruses** – Modify, overwrite, or delete files
      - **Trojan horse** – The victim downloads a fake program (e.g. a video player), and the attacker gains control
      - **Ransomware** – The attacker demands payment; if the victim pays, they get a key to unlock their data

  - **Analysis methods**:
    - **Static Analysis** – Inspecting the malware without running it (e.g. viewing its assembly code)
    - **Dynamic Analysis** – Running the malware in a controlled environment (e.g. virtual machine) to observe its behavior
